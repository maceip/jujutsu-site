# Getting Started

Welcome to the Jujutsu.js documentation!

If you have questions about anything related to Jujutsu.js, you're always welcome to ask our community on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vajitsu/jujutsu.js/discussions).

<Callout>
  This documentation assumes that you have a decent amount of knowledge about [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).   
  Not having prior knowledge of this library will hinder your experience with this framework.

## Creating a Discord Application

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click on the `New Application` button
3. Fill out the popup, then click `Create`

Your Discord application has now been created!

## Creating a Discord Bot

Now that a Discord application has been initialized, we need to create a Discord bot.

1. Select the `Bot` tab on the sidebar
2. Click the `Add Bot` button and select the confirmation button in the popup

The token should now appear under the username input area.

## Implementing Discord Token

If you have already created a `jujutsu.config.js`, add the token to the `discord.token` property.

If not, create a `jujutsu.config.js` and add the following:

<CH.Section showCopyButton={true}>

```javascript jujutsu.config.js
/** @type {import('jujutsu').JujutsuConfig} */
const jujutsuConfig = {
  discord: {
    token: 'your-token-goes-here',
  },
}

module.exports = jujutsuConfig
```

Replace [`your-token-goes-here`](focus://4[13:32]) with your bot's Discord token.

</CH.Section>

<Callout>
  **Never** share your token with anybody. If you accidentally share your bot's token, immediately reset it in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Make sure to update your token in your Jujutsu.js project.
