# Jujutsu.js CLI

The Jujutsu.js CLI allows you to start, build, and develop your application.

To get a list of the available CLI commands, run the following command inside your project directory:

<CH.Code showCopyButton={true}>
```bash Terminal
npx jujutsu --help
```
</CH.Code>

*([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher)*

The output should look like this:

```bash Terminal
Usage
  $ jujutsu <command>

Available commands
  build, start, dev, info

Options
  --version, -v   Version number
  --help, -h      Displays this message

For more information run a command with the --help flag
  $ jujutsu build --help
```

You can pass any [node arguments](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_node_options_options) to `jujutsu` commands:

```bash Terminal
NODE_OPTIONS='--throw-deprecation' jujutsu
NODE_OPTIONS='-r esm' jujutsu
NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' jujutsu
```

> **Note:** Running `jujutsu` without a command is the same as running `jujutsu dev`

## Build and Development

`jujutsu build` and `jujutsu dev` creates an optimized production build of your application. The output displays a end-to-end benchmark, it may also display errors or warnings in some cases.

Although `jujutsu dev` and `jujutsu build` have the same ouput in `.jujutsu`, during development you have hot-code reloading, error reporting, and more.

## Production

`jujutsu start` starts the application in production mode. The application should be compiled with `jujutsu build` first.

The application will start at the Discord bot using the provided token. If the token is invalid or their is not one provided, an error will be displayed.

## Info

`jujutsu info` prints relevant details about the current system which can be used to report Jujutsu.js bugs. This information includes Operating System platform/arch/version, Binaries (Node.js, npm, Yarn, pnpm) and npm package versions (`jujutsu`, `discord.js`).

Running the following in your project's root directory:

<CH.Code showCopyButton={true}>
```bash Terminal
npx jujutsu info
```
</CH.Code>

The output will give you information like this example:

```bash Terminal
Operating System:
  Platform: win32
  Arch: x64
  Version: Windows 10 Pro
Binaries:
  Node: 18.12.0
  npm: 8.19.2
  Yarn: 1.22.19
  pnpm: 7.19.0
Relevant packages:
  jujutsu: 1.0.0
  discord.js: 14.7.1
```

This information should then be pasted into GitHub Issues.
