# What is Jujutsu.js?

Jujuts.js is a flexible **Discord.js framework** that gives you building blocks to efficient Discord bots.

But what exactly do we mean by this? Letâ€™s spend some time expanding on what Discord.js and Jujutsu.js are and how they can help.

### Building Blocks of a Discord Bot

There are a few things you need to consider when building Discord applications. Such as:

- **Slash commands** - This is the most commony way a user interactions with a Discord bot.
- **Events** - The bot can take specific actions when a specific event is fired.
- **Webhooks** - Send messages to specific locations (most times including data from a website).
- **Voice** - This could be used for developing a music bot or some sort of voice interactivity.

For each part of your application, you will need to decide whether you will build a solution yourself or use other tools such as libraries and frameworks.

### What is Discord.js?

[Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/docs/discord.js/main/general/welcome) is a JavaScript library for interacting with the **Discord API**.

By the Discord API, we mean Discord bots that users interact with via the [Discord Chat App](https://discord.com).

By library, we mean Discord.js provides helpful functions to interact with the Discord API, but leaves it up to the developer where to use those functions in their application.

Discord.js is the most used library for building Discord bots with JavaScript. This has resulted in a flourishing ecosystem of third-party tools and solutions.

It also means, however, that building a complete Discord.js application from the ground up requires some effort. Developers need to spend time configuring tools and reinventing solutions for common application requirements.

### What is Jujutsu.js?

Jujutsu.js is a Discord.js **framework** that gives you building blocks to create Discord applications.

By framework, we mean Jujutsu.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for Discord.js, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.

In the next lessons, we will discuss how you can get started with Discord.js and Jujutsu.js.
